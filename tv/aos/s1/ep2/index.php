		<ul>
			<li>This episode implicitly establishes that a fair amount of time has already passed since the origin story in the previous episode, due to the large degree of familiarity now seen between Clark and Jim and even Superman and Jim. Later episodes are consistent with this too; there is no building up of the character, just the origin immediately followed by the "present".</li>
			<li>Superman makes a little flub by saying that, just as he suspected, the Aunt Louisa was a phony, when it was Clark Kent who had this suspicion. In general, I would say this version of Superman is one of the least believable in franchise history as far as the security of his secret identity is concerned, putting almost no effort into disassociating himself from Clark on any level, barely coming up with excuses, and often saying or doing things that should be very revealing...though personally, I actually find this slightly charming!</li>
