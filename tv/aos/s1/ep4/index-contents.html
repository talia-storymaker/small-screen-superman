<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A couple of men, Paul Martin and his assistant Dorn, are going around trinket shops in Metropolis, smashing cheap little statues and looking through the resulting rubble. They're paying for them, so no laws are being violated. But Lois Lane knows there must be a story here and enlists the help of a reluctant Clark Kent. Naturally, she's right, but unfortunately Dorn and Martin know she's snooping into their plans and kidnap her. Superman will need to find out what's going on and save the day.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Two men, Paul Martin and Dorn, enter a little store called Bonelli's Artcraft Shop. They proceed to throw a bunch of cheap animal statuettes on the ground, smashing them, and then look through the rubble they created. However, they're also paying for them, so the shop owner Mr. Bonelli doesn't object to their actions, though he's certainly confused. Lois Lane happens to enter the store shortly after in order to retrieve a pitcher she had repaired there and as such learns of this strange occurrance. Shortly thereafter, she goes to another store, Edwards' China and Ceramics, to get some egg cups, and learns the same thing that happened at Bonelli's happened there.</p>

<p>Lois knows there's a story here, so she starts investigating and recruits Clark Kent (who's far from enthusiastic, as he finds the whole thing rather silly) to help. The reporters split up and buy a bunch of little statues to break them open themselves, and Lois finds a key in one of them. She excitedly calls Clark and the two discuss the situation. In addition to buying statuettes themselves, the reporters have been talking to shop owners and learned that the statue-smashers found various seemingly random objects in the rubble, such as an onion and a toy cow. What they don't know is that the statue-smashers are aware of Lois' investigation and they break into her apartment and kidnap her.</p>

<p>Clark isn't aware yet of Lois being kidnapped, but he does realize how suspicious everything is. When calling one of the shops, he learns that a statue-smashing session is in progress there (being undertaken by another couple of thugs, Pete and Charlie). Thinking the situation urgent, he quickly flies over there as Superman, then changes back to Clark and enters the shop. The goons try to fight Clark, but he brushes off their attempt, grabs them both, and tells the shop owner to call the police.</p>

<p>We cut to the police station, where Inspector Henderson and Clark are talking and both are rather frustrated. Henderson explains there is no evidence either man has actually committed a crime, so the police can't hold them, even though Clark points out that one of the men described by the shopkeepers sounds like the con man Paul Martin. Clark is insistent that they should be kept in custody and throws out ideas of charges to keep them on, but Henderson rebuts his attempts and expresses annoyance with his interference.</p>

<p>Clark then heads to Lois' apartment, but when Lois doesn't open the door, he uses his x-ray vision to look inside, and sees the apartment has been trashed. He steps inside and calls police headquarters. Meanwhile, we see Martin and Dorn taking Lois to the National Import Company building and attempting to persuade her to talk about what she found, which they've apparently asked her a lot about already, to no success. They still can't get her to talk; instead, she smashes a vase on Martin's head and tries to run away, only for Dorn to grab her and hold a knife up to her. Martin tells Dorn to ease up and steals Lois' purse, and Dorn takes Lois to another room. Martin then makes a phone call, asking one of his associates to get a plane ready for a "persuasion job". Then, Martin looks through Lois' purse and finds the key she found.</p>

<p>Clark is back at the police station with Inspector Henderson, where the two learn that no fingerprints were found at Lois' apartment. In the midst of the police station scenes, we see that Martin and Dorn are driving away with a gagged and tied-up Lois. Thankfully, the police have captured Pete, one of the men they previously released, and they bring him in for questioning. The Inspector succeeds at getting him to talk by pointing out he risks life in prison due to his previous crimes. Pete explains that Martin has a place in the mountains that he accesses via an airplane he keeps at Ramsey Airport. This causes Clark to rush off, change into Superman, and stop the plane that's taking Lois away just as it's about to take off.</p>

<p>We then cut to Henderson, Clark, and Lois all gathered together (presumably Dorn was easily apprehended by Superman and arrested). Clark has a chalkboard on which he's drawn and labeled all the objects found in the statuettes (except the key). Clark explains that the objects form a rebus-like code, and combined with Lois' suggestions, they find the final result of the puzzle is a PO Box number. Based on this, the police are able to go to that post office branch and apprehend Martin as he's about to use the key to get whatever's in the box.</p>

<p>Clark, Lois, and Henderson are gathered around the box, only to find out that its contents is yet another plaster statuette. When shattered, however, it reveals the world's largest ruby that had been stolen from a museum a few years prior. Henderson and Lois comment that thanks to Clark and Superman, a great story has been uncovered, leading the mentioned reporter to reply, "Like I always say, two heads are better than one."</p>
