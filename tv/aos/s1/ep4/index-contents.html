<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A couple of men, Paul Martin and his assistant Dorn, are going around trinket shops in Metropolis, smashing cheap little statues and looking through the resulting rubble. They're paying for them, so no laws are being violated. But Lois Lane knows there must be a story here and enlists the help of a reluctant Clark Kent. Naturally, she's right, but unfortunately Dorn and Martin know she's snooping into their plans and kidnap her. Superman will need to find out what's going on and save the day.
