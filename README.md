Superman fansite - [sssuperman.com](https://www.sssuperman.com/)

I started this in 2017 when I was still in school, but didn't keep working on it for very long. In late 2023, I decided to go back to it more seriously. I implemented Twig for templates and cleaned things up (it was formerly just a very basic PHP site). The CSS and JavaScript is still pretty messy and not very modern or professional, though it's not a huge priority to improve it since I'd rather work on website features and content (I'll get to it eventually).
