		<h2>Chapter 12: Two Steps Back</h2>
		<p><em>Ugh, just what I need! </em>Jimmy thought, rubbing his head. <em>Not being able to talk to Lois or Clark anymore…</em></p><p><em>Yeah, I know! It feels like we were finally getting somewhere, too…</em></p><p>Jimmy jolted. <em>L…Lois? Is that you?</em></p><p><em>Wh…? Uh…yeah, I guess it is.</em></p><p><em>Well, that's convenient! </em>Jimmy thought at her.</p><p><em>I guess it shouldn't be a surprise that this is possible,</em> he thought – more to himself this time. <em> After all, I did hear Clark's voice in my head earlier, before I even knew what was going on.</em></p><p>Lois "took a breath". <em>Well, now that I realize what's happening…this…this is different. Jimmy, I…I think I can see through your eyes.</em></p><p><em>Y-yeah. Me too, </em>Clark said.</p><p><em>Whoa. Wild, </em>Jimmy thought. <em>I guess this makes it easier for you to help me get to the bottom of what's happening!</em> Jimmy jumped out of bed with a sense of enthusiasm he hadn't felt since Lois and Clark had become victims of the machine.</p><p>His happiness was suddenly interrupted by a cutting, throbbing pain in his head.</p><p>"OW! Ow-w…" Jimmy staggered to the ground.</p><p><em>Jimmy!</em> Clark shouted out. For a second, the word seemed to make the headache sting even more.</p><p>Jimmy simply lay on the floor for a minute. "Ooh…ugh…" He pushed himself up and rubbed his head; the pain was beginning to let up.</p><p><em>…Jimmy?</em> Clark's voice was incredibly quiet and mousy, like he wasn't really sure if he wanted to be heard.</p><p>"I-I'm fine, Clark, really," Jimmy said, thoughtlessly saying the words out loud despite not needing to. He got to his feet. "I get these pains a lot lately, but uh…I'm dealing with it, I guess. All the more reason to get you guys back in your own heads, right?" He tried to seem cheerful.</p><p>Jimmy could feel Clark's continued concern and guilt in his own head. It was kind of a strange sensation – it was sort of like being able to look at Clark's face and see the emotion on his face, except, well, the feeling was just <em>there, </em>inside his own mind, almost as though it was his own emotion, except somehow just barely removed enough that he could tell it wasn't.</p><p>"Let's, uh…let's just worry about trying to find out the answers, alright?" Jimmy continued. He felt bad that Clark felt so guilty and worried about him.</p><p><em>Er…Jimmy? Have you tried contacting Superman yet?</em> Lois asked. <em>I mean, I'm not sure what exactly he'd do, but it seems like he'd be able to help </em>somehow.</p><p>Jimmy suddenly felt a burst of intense, fearful anxiety, so much that he felt a small rush of heat go through his body – but he could tell that the emotion didn't belong to him, but to Clark.</p><p>Apparently, Lois noticed it too. <em>Uhh…something wrong, Clark?</em> she said, her concern mixed with confusion and bemusement.</p><p><em>No!</em> Clark blurted, but Jimmy could almost <em>feel </em>he was lying – not that he needed to, since Clark's continuing nervousness was still very evident.</p><p>"Uh, Clark?" Jimmy said. "What's the deal? Uh…do you…know something about Superman we don't, or something?"</p><p><em>No! I…I…</em> Suddenly, Clark seemed to be…disappearing. Almost as though he was…running away.</p><p>Clark!<em> Where are you going?!</em> Lois shouted. But it was too late; by the time the words left her mouth (well, so to speak), he was already gone.</p><p>"C-Clark? Where…where are you?" Jimmy said, a bit stunned by what had just happened.</p><p>Lois was quiet for a second. <em>He's…he's</em> <em>gone</em>, she said, as if the fact had just sunk in.</p><p>"Wh…but that makes no sense! He's in my brain! Where could he have <em>gone? </em>And…and <em>why?</em>" Jimmy said, so flustered and confused he was almost indignant – though he could feel worry creeping in too.</p><p><em>I…I don't know, Jimmy,</em> Lois said. <em>He's just…not </em>here.</p><p>Jimmy was quiet for a moment, not sure how to react or how to respond. He almost felt like how he did when looking at Clark's unconscious body. He felt a sigh deep within him.</p><p><em>L-listen, Jimmy, he couldn't have gone far!</em> Lois said. <em>I mean – like you said – he's trapped in your brain.</em></p><p>"Y-yeah, but <em>why?</em>" Jimmy said. "You just mention contacting Superman and suddenly he gets so scared he 'runs away', however that' s even possible. <em>Why?</em>"</p><p><em>Well, it's not like Clark Kent getting scared and running away is something surprising,</em> Lois said gruffly.</p><p>"Lois…" Jimmy groaned in a decidedly annoyed way.</p><p><em>Sorry, Jimmy. </em>Lois sighed. <em>I just…I just don't know what to say. That Clark…argh! I just don't </em>understand <em>him sometimes.</em></p><p>Jimmy blinked.</p><p><em>What?</em> Lois said.</p><p>"Nothing…it's just, uh…it feels like you're being a bit more critical of Clark than normal."</p><p><em>Not really. I just dial it down a bit when I'm around you,</em> Lois said.</p><p>Jimmy blinked again. This time, Lois did too…or at least it felt like she did.</p><p>"You're just being kind of…uh, <em>candid,</em>" Jimmy said.</p><p><em>Y-yeah, I guess I am,</em> Lois said, seeming to see what Jimmy was referring to. <em>I'm not really…</em>trying <em>to.</em></p><p>"Well, maybe it's because it's you're in my brain – it's harder to hide your thoughts, and all that," Jimmy suggested.</p><p><em>I guess that would make sense, </em>Lois said. <em>Hmmm…do you think that might be able to explain why Clark "ran away" too? Like, maybe he had some sort of secret…that had something to do with Superman, I guess? I mean, it doesn't make a lot of sense, but…well, what </em>else <em>could it be?</em></p><p>"Maybe. I don't know, Lois. I really don't know," Jimmy said with a sigh.</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p><em>Um…come to think of it, you never did say if you managed to contact Superman, </em>Lois said.</p><p>Jimmy sighed again. "I used my signal watch, but…he just didn't show up. Come to think of it, I don't think Superman has shown up <em>anywhere</em> in the past few days."</p><p><em>Really? Not at </em>all? Lois said.</p><p>"I don't think so," Jimmy said.</p><p><em>That's…kinda weird, </em>Lois said. <em>Well, maybe you should double-check that, Jimmy. Heck, maybe you can even convince the chief to give you that as an assignment or something.</em></p><p>"Yeah…oh, <em>snap!</em> I'd better get ready for work, and <em>stat!</em>" Jimmy said. He jumped up and started removing his pajamas.</p><p>Lois began to feel uncomfortable.</p><p>Jimmy stopped in the middle of pulling off his pants. "Oh, uh…yeah, I guess this is kinda…awkward…"</p><p><em>D-don't worry about me, Jimmy. Seriously, </em>Lois said. <em>You have to get ready and…do what you have to do. I mean, there's no way around it. So just don't…worry about me, or anything.</em></p><p>"Um, alright," Jimmy said. <em>I'll already be worrying enough about Clark, anyway…</em></p>
