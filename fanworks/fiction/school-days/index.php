		<p>"Where's
Eben?" I asked the minor Justice League member manning the satellite control
panel, a sense of urgency and irritation in my voice - and perhaps even a
twinge of desperation, even though I hadn't been looking for him for more than
a minute.</p>
<p>            "Huh?
Oh, yeah, he got moved to like...another one of the testing rooms," the superhero
replied, peering up at me with his young eyes through his bright yellow mask. "Laboratory
D, I think..."</p>
<p>            I
heaved out a sigh filled with exasperation and annoyance. "Thank you!" I
shouted back to the hero as I walked off.</p>
<p>            He
<i>had </i>to be in one of the rooms of the satellite that happened to have
lead walls, didn't he? Well...I guess it didn't matter. I guess there's nothing
wrong with him being moved to a different room, they're probably just trying to
find ways to take better care of him, and there was no real reason for me to
get upset.</p>
<p>            It's
just, well...he's my kid. I hadn't seen him all day, and I was worried about him.</p>
<p>            I
finally made it to Laboratory D. I guess that wasn't a particularly surprising
place to put him, they deal with volatile energies in there a lot. I just,
well, really hoped he was okay, and that he hadn't gotten hard to contain or
anything. I opened the thick metal door and walked in.</p>
<p>            Several
science-y DC Comics characters were huddled around a man-sized cylindrical container
hooked up to all sorts of machinery and full of blazing white energy. As soon
as I entered the room, the energy flared even more brightly, to the point it
might be painful to look at for most beings, and I heard a voice nearly
identical to my own, other than possessing a bizarre echoing quality as though
it was run through some kind of audio filter, emanating from the container.
"Dad!"</p>
<p>            "Ben!"
I shouted. The scientists wasted no time getting out of the way as I ran up to
the container and hugged it, an action I did totally without thinking.</p>
<p>            I
heard one of them grunt. "Excuse me, we were in the middle of a very precise
procedure -"</p>
<p>            "It's
alright. It's nothing that we can't pick up again later," another scientist
said gently, abruptly intercepting. "We're just continuing to study Eben,
trying to learn more about him, but there's nothing especially urgent going
on."</p>
<p>            "Alright."
I set the container with my son in it down. "No issues of any kind? He's
staying contained and everything?"</p>
<p>            The
scientist nodded. "Yes, everything seems fine. Though, I suppose he is a
bit...restless."</p>
<p>            "Have
you just been working on testing him all day?" I asked.</p>
<p>            "More
or less."</p>
<p>            "Then,
I guess that's not surprising," I said. "...I mean, yeah, it's understandable
that doing your testing is very important, but, you know..."</p>
<p>            The
scientist sighed. "Yes. It's regrettable. We'll leave you be to spend some time
with him, if you like."</p>
<p>            "Yes,
yes please." I smiled. "Thank you."</p>
<p>            In
short order, that scientist had rounded up all his fellows, left the premises,
and shut that sturdy metal door. I turned to my son again.</p>
<p>            I
saw the white energy forming itself roughly into the shape of a man. It was too
rough to really make out facial features or anything, but I could still tell
that he was trying to emulate my own appearance, in his own blazing, blobby way
- just as he did when he first emerged from my body. Almost as though it were
an instinctual thing. It was hardly surprising that, among all the other things
he had "inherited" from my mind and being, a desire to take my form would be
among them.</p>
<p>            I
smiled at his attempt. "How are you doing?"</p>
<p>            "Um,
I'm okay," his eerily resonating voice came in reply. "I mean, I missed you a
lot and I haven't been able to do anything except be checked on by those
scientists, and um...I guess I did get kind of tired of that. But they were nice
and...everything's fine. I just...I just get really tired of it, and I feel lonely
and...um...yeah." I saw his form shift into the back corner of the container, and
imagined he was trying to lean against the back of it dejectedly as a person
with a solid body would, but in the process he lost much of his shape, as
though his emotions were causing him to fail to maintain it.</p>
<p>            My
heart went out to him. "I'm sorry, Ben. I know it can't be easy." I knelt down
and touched the container with one hand, stroking it slightly. "It has to be
tough right now, like...being in a hospital. But just like being in the hospital,
it won't last. I promise."</p>
<p>            There
was a pause. I noticed Ben began to get a bit of his humanoid shape back. "But
even then, what do I do?"</p>
<p>            I
felt a small sigh deep within me, but tried not to express it. "We don't really
know that, yet. But that's OK. Not many people know their place in life when
they just start out, you know. You're not even a week old, you know! You have
plenty of time."</p>
<p>            Ben
let out a light chuckle.</p>
<p>            "Trust
me, kid: You have a purpose in life, and it's going to be a good one. You might
be different, but sometimes it's the ways in which we're different that turn
out to be the most helpful to others. We may not know exactly why you exist or
what to do with you right now, and you might not either, but that's okay,
really. We'll figure out an answer. <i>You'll </i>figure out an answer. I
promise." I smiled at him and gave his container a stroke. "That's how it
happened for me, and it'll happen for you too."</p>
<p>            Somehow,
I could tell he smiled back.</p>
<p>            "So,
where's Mom?" Ben asked after a moment's pause.</p>
<p>            I
sighed. "She's not feeling too well, I'm afraid. They actually sent her home
from work. Just a little cold, I guess...she'll get better soon, and be able to
see you, I'm sure." I gave a half-hearted smile.</p>
<p>            "Oh...I'm
sorry about that..." Ben said in a downcast way. "I wish I could do something...for
her."</p>
<p>            "Aw,
Ben. Not even I can cure people's sicknesses," I said.</p>
<p>            "No,
no, I mean...you know. Make her a get-well card or breakfast in bed or
something," Ben clarified. "But...I can't. Because, you know. I have to stay in
this tube or...something bad might happen." I saw his form crumpling into random
heaps of energy again.</p>
<p>            My
heart began to hurt for him. (Well, not literally because I don't generally
feel pain, but it was certainly a strong emotion.) "I'm sorry, Ben. But you
know, those scientists working on you, learning more about you...they're going to
find a better way. I'm sure they will."</p>
<p>            Ben
seemed to sigh - his sigh kind of sounded like a static fizzle, but it still
registered as a sigh to me, somehow. "OK, Dad. I understand."</p>
<p>            "I'll
make sure to give Mom your well-wishes," I said. "I know they'll mean a lot to
her. And I know she wants to be here, too - and I'm sure she will be, soon."</p>
<p>            "Thanks,"
Ben said, a slight amount of cheer emerging.</p>
<p>            After
a momentary pause, Ben asked, "So, how was your day, Dad?"</p>
<p>            "I
had a pretty good day," I said. "Things were pretty uneventful in
Metropolis...and around the world, honestly. Still keeping an eye on things, of
course, and there's certainly stuff going on in the world, just...not much that
really screams 'This is a job for Superman'. I can't just charge in and force
people to fix everything, no matter how much I might want to." I gave a
semi-chuckle. "Work wasn't too exciting either, but things went well. It's
never the same without Lois around, but at least I got to write a nice piece
for my new column."</p>
<p>            "Hey,
can I see it?" Ben said.</p>
<p>            "Sure!"
I said, feeling a swell of pride and pleasure at his interest. I pulled today's
newspaper out of a pouch on my cape and flipped to the section containing what
I had written. Then, I pressed it against Ben's container.</p>
<p>            "I
use this column to reflect on some of the interesting people and places in
Metropolis, their histories, and their stories," I said. "Sort of a
community-building thing. Today, I talked about Nature's Blessing, a store
focused on alternative medicine and natural remedies that's been in Metropolis
since the homeopathy boom of the 1970s. They also happen to be home of some of
the best organic tea in town - they're my go-to place for tea, really, so being
able to write about them was a great opportunity," I said. "The owners had some
really interesting stories to share...well, I'll let you read them for yourself."</p>
<p>            I
thought that I could perceive Ben scanning the page somehow, his eyes darting
back and forth, even though he didn't really have distinct, visible facial
features. Come to think of it, I didn't exactly know how he was even capable of
sight or hearing. But then again, I also didn't know how he able to think,
feel, speak, or just <i>exist </i>in general. All I knew is that my body
absorbed a ton of cosmic radiation and later expelled it, and when it did...he
was there. A sentient being of pure energy, possessing traces of my thoughts,
memories, and personality, not knowing anything more about himself than I did.
All he seemed to know was who I was and that he came from me. I didn't know
what he was or how to react or even really what to <i>do </i>with him. All I
had was the knowledge that he was...mine. I had brought him into the world,
somehow. And he was alive, thinking, feeling.</p>
<p>            He
needed a name, so I named him Eben, after my father's middle name. Eben Kent...or
Ben as we had taken to calling him, since Lois thought Eben was kinda a weird
name. Lois is kinda his adoptive mother now, since she's my wife and all. She
didn't exactly know what to make of him at first, but she was very supportive
of my efforts to... "raise" him, if that was even the right word.</p>
<p>            It
was kind of crazy. Suddenly I was a father in a way I could have never even
imagined. And emotionally, it's just...I could have never even imagined this
feeling. This intense connection I felt to him and desire to pour myself into
his life, this sense of love and kinship and protectiveness. All towards a
being like nothing I had ever seen before...that I couldn't even comprehend,
really.</p>
<p>            And
then there was the heartache. I wanted to give him the world, I wanted to make
him happy, I wanted to give him a life as least as good as my own, if not even
better. But as of yet, he couldn't live anything close to a normal life, and
not only that, but he had to be carefully contained lest he, well, go wild. </p>
<p>Living
one's life in a container just big enough to hold you, not being able to go out
and nothing and no one able to ever come in with you, stuck on a lab on a
satellite. It wasn't exactly a life I would want for anyone. And it was the
life my own son had been given. And, currently, I couldn't do anything about it.</p>
<p>That
was hard to deal with.</p>
<p>            "All
done, Dad!" Ben said in a chipper voice.</p>
<p>            "What
did you think?" I asked, his voice yanking me out of the moroseness of my
thoughts and back to the importance of making the most of the time I had with
him right now.</p>
<p>            "Um,
it was good. I...don't know. Doesn't seem like a very exciting assignment to me."</p>
<p>            "Well,
it wasn't, exactly. But hey, excitement isn't everything," I said, my own cheer
returning.</p>
<p>            "Yeah,
I guess not," Ben said. There was a short pause. "Uh...I don't really think I
understood everything in that article."</p>
<p>            "Oh?
What didn't you?" I asked.</p>
<p>            "I...don't
know. It's hard to place. I just...feel like I don't have enough background
knowledge, I guess. Like, I only <i>half-</i>understood everything."</p>
<p>            "Hmm,"
I said. I had always been able to tell that Ben seemed to share a lot of my
knowledge from the moment he was "born", but it seemed like only a general
understanding or vague recollection. Just a little more confirmation that what
I was about to do next was a good choice.</p>
<p>            I
finally removed my hand and the newspaper from their position pressed up
against Ben's housing. "Say, Ben...that reminds me. How would you like to...learn a
little more about the world?"</p>
<p>            "Huh?"
Ben said, "blinking" (though perhaps that was just my imagination). "What do
you mean?"</p>
<p>            I
took a deep breath and began wearing a slightly awkward smile. "School."</p>
<p>            Ben
reeled back in shock. "School?!"</p>
<p>            "Erm...not
<i>going </i>to school," I clarified. "I mean...just me teaching you, right here
and now."</p>
<p>            "Umm...okay?"
Ben said. "Like, uh...homeschooling?"</p>
<p>            "Sorta,
yeah," I said.</p>
<p>            Ben
paused. "Alright, I guess. Though...why, exactly?"</p>
<p>            I
shrugged. "Well, I want you to be well-educated. It's just something that's
probably going to be helpful, no matter where life takes you. You know?"</p>
<p>            "Yeah...I
guess," Ben said. "I mean, I feel like I already know a bunch of general stuff,
that I must've just gotten from you. But I guess I don't really...understand it
that well. It's just kinda there."</p>
<p>            "And,
would you like to understand it better?" I asked.</p>
<p>            "...Yeah.
Yeah, I do, actually," Ben said.</p>
<p>            I
smiled. "Good."</p>
<p>            Ben
sighed. "It's just that...well, I don't really see what the point is. I'm just a
blob of energy. I mean...why do I need to know anything?"</p>
<p>            "Why
does anyone else need to know anything? They're all just blobs of matter," I
said, giving Ben's container a playful rub as though I was ruffling his hair.</p>
<p>            "Da-ad!"
my son said in a laughing way at my cheesy style of phrase-turning.</p>
<p>            I
took a breath. "Well, seriously, Ben. You don't <i>really </i>know what your
future holds. And you're more than just a bunch of energy, you have a mind,
somehow. So...as long as you have it, why not use it?" I gave him a slight smile
and cocked my head to one side, gesturing with my eyes to let him know the ball
was in his court now.</p>
<p>            Ben
looked down for a moment. Then he looked at me. "Yeah. You're right, Dad," he
said with a smile. "I guess I do kinda <i>want </i>to know more, even if I
don't have a clear idea of what I'll do with it."</p>
<p>            "Great,"
I said. I reached into my cape and pulled out some papers. "Before we start, I
feel like we should do a little assessment. Find out how much you already know.
Hmmm, let's start with..." I moved my finger along the page in my hand
facetiously, even though it didn't actually contain any information I needed.
"The ABC's!" I said, looking up and grinning.</p>
<p>            "The
ABC's?!" Ben scoffed lightly. "Oh, come on, Dad!"</p>
<p>            "No,
I'm serious," I said. "Let's hear them."</p>
<p>            "Wh...why?"
Ben said. "Don't you have faith that I at least know <i>that?"</i></p>
<p>            I
shrugged. "You never know."</p>
<p>            Ben
sighed and "rolled his eyes". "A, B, C, D, E, F, G...H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O..." He
paused. "L, M, N, O...P?"</p>
<p>            "Right,"
I said encouragingly.</p>
<p>            Ben
seemed dumbfounded in disbelief. "I...I don't...I don't know them perfectly?" he
said after a moment.</p>
<p>            "Well,
just keep going. Just do the best you can," I said.</p>
<p>            "But...but...how
do I not know them all by heart?!" Ben said.</p>
<p>            "The
real question is, how do you know <i>any </i>of them? How were you <i>born</i>
having as much knowledge as you do?" I pointed out.</p>
<p>            "Y-yeah,
but...I can <i>read!</i> You would think that level of literacy would subsume
knowing the ABC's!" Ben said, exasperated. "And I even know the word 'subsume'!
What's going on?!"</p>
<p>            I
sighed. "Well, in honesty, Ben, I don't know. There's a lot we don't know about
you - a lot more than we <i>do </i>know, to be quite frank. But, if I had to
venture a guess...maybe how well you 'inherited' information from me has to do
with how important it is to me, or something. I mean, the ability to read and
write is obviously very important to me - I mean, I write for a living, after
all! The specific order of letters...that's a pretty minor detail. And I guess
you can remember the end result of a skill without remembering every step it
took to get there, you know?"</p>
<p>            "Yeah...I
<i>guess </i>that makes sense..." Ben said.</p>
<p>            "So,
anyway, how about those letters? L M N O P...what comes next? Do you know?" I
said, grinning at him.</p>
<p>            Ben
"smirked" at me. "If knowing the alphabet is just a step along the way to
literacy, do I really need to know it if I already know how to read?"</p>
<p>            I
gave him a sideways smirk in return. "Pretty clever for someone who doesn't
even know his ABC's."</p>
<p>            "Da-ad!"
Ben "groaned", though I could tell he was really a bit amused. "What makes you
so sure I don't know them, anyway? I mean, just because I had a little memory
lapse..."</p>
<p>            "Well,
if you know them, go ahead right ahead and prove me wrong, why don't you?" I
said, winking.</p>
<p>            "Ughh..<i>.</i>.<i>fine!</i>"
Ben said smilingly. "A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O...<i>P</i>..." He
paused for a moment. I could almost "feel" his sense of drawing a blank, of
mild panic. "I...I...I really don't know them!" he said, distress evident in his
voice.</p>
<p>            "Oh,
Ben." I laid a hand on his container. "Come on. You just said yourself that it
doesn't really matter."</p>
<p>            "Yeah...b-but..."
He looked down and gave an exasperated sigh. "I just don't get it, Dad! I just
don't understand myself! How can I be so smart and so dumb at the same time?"</p>
<p>            I
gave a softer sigh. "Oh, Ben..." I looked down myself, then I looked at my son.
"Who you are, what you are, how you think...I guess...none of us really understand
it. But I guess...you have to accept it, too. Even if you aren't like other
people. Even if you don't exactly make sense by normal standards. It doesn't
mean you're bad or dumb. You're just...you. Just try to be the best you that you
can be, I guess."</p>
<p>            I
gave a weak smile. But deep down, I was beginning to doubt myself.</p>
<p>            Maybe
this was a dumb idea. This whole "school" thing...it was kinda treating Ben like something
remotely approximating a "normal kid" when he obviously wasn't. Maybe nothing
good would come out of it. Maybe <i>I </i>needed to try to focus Ben on things
that were actually relevant to what he was...</p>
<p>            The
thing is, I didn't <i>know </i>what Ben was, so that was going to be hard. I was
just trying to do what I knew to do, but...maybe I was just conditioning Ben to
try to be something he couldn't be. Or maybe I was just wasting my time. Maybe
I was just coming up with random, pointless busywork. I didn't know.</p>
<p>            Ben
sighed. "No point in being melodramatic, I guess..." He took a deep breath.
"Maybe...you could just teach me the whole ABC's. Just because."</p>
<p>            I
was quiet for just a moment. "Alright, Ben." I took a deep breath. Then I began
singing.</p>
<p>            "A,
B, C, D, E, F, G...H, I, J, K, L-M-N-O-P. Q, R, S...T, U, V...W, X. Y and Z."</p>
<p>            Suddenly
I heard a soft voice coming from Ben's container. "Now I know my ABC's...next
time won't you sing with me."</p>
<p>            I
blinked.</p>
<p>            "I
guess I remembered that part," Ben said. "Not technically a part of the ABC's,
but...it's something."</p>
<p>            I
smiled and rubbed Ben's container again. "Yeah, it's something."</p>
