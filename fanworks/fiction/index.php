		<h1 id="beginning">Superman Fan Fiction</h1>
		<p>Here's some Superman fan fiction I've written. Most of it is probably also available elsewhere, but I wanted to put it on my own site too.</p>
		<h2>Fun in the Sun</h2>
		<p>Finished Aug. 21, 2016</p>
		<p>Just a simple slice-of-life story about Clark, Lois and Jimmy taking a trip to the beach.</p>

		<h2>School Days</h2>
		<p>Finished Sept. 11, 2016</p>
		<p>A pretty weird story based on an unusual concept I had for Superman to have a "son".</p>

		<h2>An Odd Place to Find Oneself</h2>
		<p>Started May 9, 2015<br>Last updated Jan. 1, 2017</p>
		<p>A multi-chapter story. It's not finished and unfortunately it's quite possible it never will be, but I'm putting it here anyway just because. Based on Superman: The Animated Series (especially the episode "Two's a Crowd"). An apparently innocent demonstration of new STAR Labs technology to Clark, Lois & Jimmy results in the former two becoming comatose - or so it seems. The two star reporters find themselves in a world that seems like their own...but yet isn't. Meanwhile, Jimmy becomes suspicious concerning what really happened.</p>
