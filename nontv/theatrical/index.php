		<h1 id="beginning">Superman in Theatres</h1>
		<p>This section could include information on the Fleischer/Famous cartoons and film serials as well as information on what we would more traditionally think of as "Superman movies" (though, the latter might be a lower priority or not as well covered since it's already got a lot of attention elsewhere). Of course, <i>Superman and the Mole Men</i> will probably have the most attention considering its connection to the <i>Adventures of Superman</i>! But as you can probably see, there's nothing here yet.</p>
